# HOI4 Construction Simulator

A Streamlit-based simulator for **Hearts of Iron 4** construction mechanics.
The project is still uncomplete.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd hoi4_construction_sim

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Run the application:**
bash

streamlit run app.py


### Current issues

Dams are probably not working as intended
Multiple queued factories will only build one
Infrastructure is not properly implemented 
Wrong max factory in state logic 
Basic research does not take into account dispersed or concentrated differences



### To be implemented

High priority : 
Focus tree order and corresponding bonuses
Research order 


Low priority : 
Ressources 


### UI
